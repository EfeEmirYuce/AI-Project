# Smart Route Navigator

This is a web-based map app that finds the shortest path between two points using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**.

## Features
- Interactive Leaflet map
- Click to select start and end points
- Shows shortest path with distance
- Uses traffic weights for realism
- Dijkstra and A* algorithms for comparison

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click two points on the map.
3. See the shortest route drawn.
4. Use the reset button to start over.
